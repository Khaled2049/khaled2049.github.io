      <description>State of Novel Sync as of 2/17/2025 Okay, so I know haven&amp;rsquo;t been giving plenty of updates here, and I honestly have no excuses. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on novel-sync and adding features left and right. There’s still a lot to improve and polish, but by the end of this year, I expect this project to be pretty solid. My current goal is simply to keep enhancing it. Once I&amp;rsquo;ve added all the main features, I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on polishing it and writing about what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned.</description>

      <description>2025 is here, and it’s shaping up to be the year of big, bold moves. There’s one goal I’ve set that stands above everything else on my list: starting a startup.
Over the years, I’ve toyed with ideas, side projects, and what-ifs. But there’s something about 2025 that feels different. This is the year to turn thoughts into action and ambition into reality. Starting a startup isn’t just about building a product or a service; it’s about building a life on my own terms, driven by passion, curiosity, and a desire to solve real-world problems.</description>

      <description>I love reading books, and I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to create a startup. We’re often encouraged to follow our passions and spend time doing what we enjoy, so I decided to combine the two things I love. That’s how my journey with NovelSync began.
I’m not expecting to make money from this project, and that’s perfectly fine. My goal is to create a space where others can come together to read, write and share stories.</description>
