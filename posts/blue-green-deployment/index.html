  "articleBody": "AWS RDS Blue-Green Deployment for Major Version Upgrade One of my first key tasks in my new role was upgrading our AWS RDS cluster from PostgreSQL 14 to 16. When dealing with database upgrades, I always lean toward a cautious approach to minimize risk. Our cluster was running on version 14, and a major version upgrade was required to bring it up to 16.\nIn this blog, I’ll walk you through the steps I took to complete this upgrade with minimal risk and zero downtime. The primary reason for this upgrade was our need for logical replication. We regularly sync our database with Snowflake, but due to how deletions were handled, some records would persist in queries even after being deleted from the source database.\nOur Fivetran connector was configured to use the XMIN incremental update method, which does not support syncing deleted rows in incremental syncs. This limitation made logical replication essential for ensuring accurate data synchronization.\nFrom the Fivetran documentation: “The XMIN method is based on the hidden xmin system column that is present in all PostgreSQL tables. With XMIN, Fivetran must scan every table in full to detect updated data. We do not recommend XMIN for near real-time data needs because XMIN replication is slower than logical replication and doesn’t allow Fivetran to detect deleted rows.”\nFivetran’s recommended approach for efficient data syncing is logical replication. This method performs an initial load of the source table’s data and then continuously replicates ongoing changes—including deletions. However, logical replication is only supported in PostgreSQL 16+, making our upgrade essential.\nHow to Perform the Upgrade with Minimal Risk and Zero Downtime To achieve a seamless transition, I followed a blue-green deployment strategy to minimize disruptions. There might be other ways to approach this, but for our use case, this method worked effectively.\nFollow these steps for each environment (e.g., DEV, UAT, and PROD):\nCreate a snapshot of the existing database. This serves as a backup in case of any issues during the upgrade process. Set up a new cluster in parallel with the existing database. The new cluster should be created from the snapshot, using the same engine version as the snapshot. Ensure it has the same username and password for authentication consistency. The DBClusterIdentifier will be different from the original. Perform an incremental upgrade: First, upgrade the database from PostgreSQL 14 to 15. Upgrade the database from PostgreSQL 15 to 16. Configure logical replication: During the second deployment, create a DB cluster parameter group and set logical replication to 1. Execute the final cutover deployment: Update the secrets to point to the new cluster, ensuring a smooth transition without downtime. By following this approach, we successfully upgraded our AWS RDS cluster while maintaining data integrity and minimizing disruptions. If you’re facing a similar upgrade challenge, this method provides a structured way to execute it safely.\n",
